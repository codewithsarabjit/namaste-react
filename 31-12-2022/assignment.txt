what is JSX?
it is an extension to javascript. It allows us to write HTML in javascript and place them in DOM without use of any javascript functions like 
append or create element.

Superpowers of JSX?
1. write HTML in javascript
2. we can pass jsx into javascript variables
3. JSX supports all javascript expressions and loops.
4. we can use JSX element attributes as props in the child components.

Role of type attribute in script tag. what options can we use.
type attribute in script tag is to tell browser or js engine that what kind of javascript code is present in that file.
1. we can type="module" to tell js engine that the js file being imported is a module and not plan javascript.
2. "importmap" is another option which basically tells how to resolve the different ES javascript modules into the HTML.
example if there is a module name event then it should resolve to "path/src/event.js"

{TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent />} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX?
{<TitleComponent />} is the correct way to call a child component in JSX.
